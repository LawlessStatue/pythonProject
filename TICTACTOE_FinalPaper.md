        Final Project Paper (Computer Science) 

Just wanted to point out that any errors in the final project code were intended to be there. Please don't fix it as the code will not run if changed. 

Requirements:

The rules of playing Tic-Tac-Toe (modified version)

Step One: choose a game mode to play in, whether that is against the computer, or against another player. 

Step Two: choose a symbol to play as whether it is X or O. 

Step Three: Play the game and have fun. 

The Objective of TIC-TAC-TOE is to get three straight, diagonal, or horizontal of your symbol in order to win the game. 

In order to understand the board, recall this feature:
7 |  8 |  9
4 |  5 |  6
1 |  2 |  3

Design:

I created the game using:

Classes: TicTacToe, Board, Player

Objects: TicTacToe(), Player(), Board()

Functions: CheckPlayerWin, DrawBoard, PlayerMove, FindEmptySpaces, GetPlayerChoice, CheckWin, Verify Position, ChangeType, Move, and Round
